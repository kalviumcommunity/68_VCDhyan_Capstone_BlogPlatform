Overview
The AI-Powered Blog Platform is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and manage blog posts with AI-assisted content generation, SEO optimization, and comment moderation. The platform is built using React.js for the frontend, Express.js & Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.
On the frontend, the application is built using React.js with React Router for navigation and Axios for API communication. The UI is designed with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive look. Users can browse blogs, search by title or category, and perform authentication-based actions such as creating, updating, or deleting blog posts. The frontend also integrates AI-powered content suggestions, where users can generate summaries and improve their blog content with a single click.
On the backend, Express.js handles the API requests, while MongoDB (with Mongoose ORM) is used for storing blog data, user authentication details, and comments. The backend includes secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcrypt.js for password hashing. The API supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for blogs and comments, along with AI-powered SEO analysis to suggest relevant keywords for better search visibility.
The AI integration is powered by OpenAI's GPT API, which enhances blog content by auto-generating summaries, suggesting improvements, and providing keyword recommendations. AI is also used for comment moderation, automatically detecting and filtering spam or offensive comments to maintain a high-quality discussion environment.
For deployment, the backend is hosted on Render or Vercel, while the frontend is deployed on Netlify or Vercel. The database is managed through MongoDB Atlas, ensuring scalability and reliability. The project follows GitHub project management, with a structured workflow that includes version control, issue tracking, and milestone progress monitoring.
This project demonstrates the power of AI-driven content creation and moderation, making blogging more efficient and user-friendly. It incorporates modern web development best practices, RESTful API architecture, authentication mechanisms, and AI-powered automation, providing a fully functional and intelligent blog platform.
